# Face Generation - GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model for generating realistic human faces. GANs are a class of deep learning models that consist of two components: a generator network that produces synthetic data and a discriminator network that tries to distinguish between real and fake data.

## Introduction

Face generation is an exciting area in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. GANs have shown great success in generating realistic and high-quality images, making them suitable for generating human faces. The goal of this project is to develop a GAN model capable of synthesizing new and realistic face images.

The generator network learns to generate faces that resemble real human faces, while the discriminator network learns to differentiate between real face images and the synthetic ones created by the generator. Through an adversarial training process, the generator and discriminator networks compete and improve over time.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the GAN model is not included in this repository due to licensing and privacy restrictions. However, the code assumes that the dataset consists of a collection of face images. It is important to curate a diverse and representative dataset to train a GAN effectively.

Ensure that the dataset is organized in a suitable directory structure and adjust the code accordingly. Preprocessing steps such as cropping, resizing, and normalization may be required depending on the dataset.

## Model Architecture

The GAN model is composed of two main components: the generator and the discriminator.

The generator network takes random noise as input and generates synthetic face images. It typically consists of several layers of convolutional and upsampling operations, gradually transforming the noise into realistic face-like features.

The discriminator network, on the other hand, takes either a real face image or a synthetic image generated by the generator and tries to classify it correctly. It consists of several layers of convolutional and downsampling operations, aiming to learn the distinguishing features of real faces.

The generator and discriminator networks are trained together in an adversarial manner, with the goal of improving the quality of generated face images over time.

## Installation

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aatmprakash/Face-Generation---GANs-Generative-Adversarial-Networks.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset of face images and adjust the code to handle the directory structure and preprocessing steps, if necessary.

## Usage

Before running the code, make sure you have installed the required dependencies and prepared your dataset accordingly.

To train the GAN model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

The model will begin training using the specified dataset and hyperparameters. The trained generator and discriminator models will be saved for future use.

To generate new face images using the trained model, run the following command:

```
python generate_faces.py --generator saved_models/generator.pth --num_faces 10
```

Replace `generator.pth` with the appropriate saved generator model checkpoint file. Adjust `num_faces` to generate the desired number of face images.

## Results

The quality of the generated face images can be subjective and may vary based on the dataset, model architecture, and training parameters. The results obtained from the trained model can

 be evaluated visually to assess the realism and diversity of the generated faces.

Generated face images can be saved and used for various applications such as data augmentation, virtual characters, and creative art.
